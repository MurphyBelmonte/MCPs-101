## Tier 1: Best ROI (Low Competition, Good Pay)

- Catch: Need to pass screening, but MCP expertise gives you an edge

**Contra**

- Pay: $5k-20k projects typical
- Sweet spot: Perfect for "AI integration" positioning

## Tier 2: Good Volume + Moderate Competition

**Upwork**
- Why: Huge volume, you can create a niche
- Search terms to target: "AI integration," "Claude API," "automation," not "MCP" (clients don't know the term yet)

## Tier 3: Volume Play (Higher Competition)

**Fiverr**

- Use case: "I will set up Claude AI for your business" packages

## Hidden Gems (Low Competition)

## Pro Tips:

1. Don't use "MCP" in your pitches - clients don't know what it means. Say "Claude AI integration" or "AI automation"
2. Lead with outcomes: "I help businesses save 10 hours/week on bookkeeping using AI" not "I build MCP servers"
3. Target these search terms on Upwork:
   - "Claude integration" 
   - "AI automation"
   - "QuickBooks API"
   - "Business process automation"
4. Sweet spot clients: 10-50 person companies (big enough to have budget, small enough to move fast)

=== TOPTAL vs CONTRA STRATEGY ===

**Toptal Advantages:**
- Pay: $75-150/hr vs Contra's $50-100/hr typical
- Client quality: Enterprise clients with bigger budgets
- Prestige: Being accepted signals you're top-tier

**Contra Advantages:**
- No screening barrier - start immediately
- Faster onboarding - upload portfolio, start pitching
- Less intimidating - good for building initial confidence

**The Screening Trade-off:**
- Toptal screening: Takes 2-4 weeks, but MCP expertise gives huge advantage
- Contra: Start today, but competing on general "AI integration" skills

**RECOMMENDED STRATEGY:**
1. Start with Contra immediately - get first 1-2 projects, build portfolio
2. Apply to Toptal in parallel - while working on Contra projects  
3. Use Contra success stories in Toptal application

Why this works:
- Earn while waiting for Toptal approval
- Contra projects become proof of MCP expertise for Toptal
- Don't lose 2-4 weeks of potential income

Bottom line: Toptal has higher ceiling, but Contra lets you start earning immediately. Do both - just start with Contra first.

Think of Contra as your "launch pad" and Toptal as your "upgrade path."
